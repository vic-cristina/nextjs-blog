I’ve been thinking a lot about forgiveness lately, but also pride, wondering if it’s ever going to be possible to forgive my father for what he had done when I was a child. Of course we had our great moments after I grew up to be a young adult, but as the years progressed I couldn’t help but feel the grudge boiling up in my stomach, for sure that one has been the hardest to digest, as my bowels are still complaining up til this moment in time.

Today I found a way of letting it all out as I was scrubbing the kitchen floor, getting back to a kind of bitter nostalgia that always hits me whenever I have to devote more time than I’d want to do just about any house chore. Of course that doing chores in and of itself isn’t the worst thing I’d choose of all the things we have to go through in order to function in this deranged world, but when you have a lot on your mind about other things that you’d rather be doing, that you consider more valuable than that, because they’d lead to greater reward in the long run, then you feel like shit and just pour it all out by moving your arms with more strength than it’d be necessary to clean up the mess you and your wife made in the kitchen the other day.

There’s no happy ending to this little rant of mine, no closure, only the unanswered question of whether it’d ever be entirely possible to just remember the trauma which came together when father used to force me to do his greasy dishes everyday (or clean up after the little cup of half-tasted yogurt he blatantly threw on floor after I complained about the abuse) and thoroughly wash the bathroom while I’d rather be studying, reading or playing games as a 10 year old kid - I mean, to just reminisce and see it like just another part of your life, without all the suffering. Maybe then, once all of that is sorted out inside me, I’d appreciate the supposed little pleasures that come together with adulthood.
